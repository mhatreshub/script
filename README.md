Hi Greg,
I am Ben from Business Reporting & Metrics team and my team works on scheduled reporting as well as adhoc requests that come in from PAN Leadership.

In order to perform my duties I am compelled to manually collect the PAN data from multiple source.
I send out emails to various people or department to gather relevant & required data from them.
I need to make some phone calls to people I know can have useful data and store it.
Sometimes i also need to meet people in person for other details for required data.

Using all this raw data, I have a process ready which filters the data and pull out useful data from them.
I store this data with which can can be used in various places.
Then various people ask me to have reports, so I make reports out of data I have out of my process.
I generate a report and send it to team.
Then generate some other report and send to other team.
Sometimes I also need to generate adhoc reports and send it to the teams.

Yeah, Hurray!
I have done an awesome job.

Oh, but hang on...
What if anyone of them have some problems or queries regarding some data or something.

They need to come back to me so that i can make some adjustmenstr in the data and let the data pass through the same process and generate the required reports again, hopfully correct data this time.

But This will cost us time. Also It is not so accurate since it can have errors.

Thats means the approach sadly is not so interesting.
